Question 1

query_text = "What are the most signficant non-modifiable risk factors for age related macular degeneration?"
ideal_response = "Nonmodifiable risk factors for age related macular degeneration include older age and genetic risk."

Question 2

query_text = "What is the role of antioxidant vitamins in age related macular degeneration?"
ideal_response = "There is lack of conclusive evidence about the benefit of multivitamin supplements in AMD, but antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E), may help reduce the risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration by neutralizing free radicalsÓ

Question 3

query_text = "What are some serious risks of anti-VEGF therapy for age related macular degeneration?"
ideal_response = "Serious risks of anti-VEGF therapy include infection and retinal detachment"

Question 4

query_text = "Is the course of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) more correlated with postmenstrual age or postnatal age?"
ideal_response = "The course of ROP is more correlated with postmenstrual age (PMA) than postnatal age"

Question 5

query_text = "When do we initiate retinal examinations for infants born at 22 to 27 weeks and for infants born at 28 weeks or more?"
ideal_response = "We initiate retinal examinations at 31 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) for infants born at 22 to 27 weeks and at four weeks of chronologic age for infants born at ³28 weeks"

Question 6

query_text = "What is on the differential diagnosis of panuveitis?"
ideal_response = "The differential diagnosis of panuveitis includes bacterial and viral infections, scleritis, uveitis, and various systemic diseases such as Behet's disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and birdshot chorioretinopathy"

Question 7

query_text = "What is the role of intravitreal glucocorticoids in the therapy of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)."
ideal_response = "Intravitreal glucocorticoids can be used off-label to treat macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), improving visual outcomes."

Question 8 

query_text = "What is the most common type of retinal detachment?"
ideal_response = "A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is themost common type of retinal detachment."

Question 9 

query_text = "What are the primary challenges of anti-VEGF treatment?"
ideal_response = "A primary challenge of VEGF inhibitor therapy is the need for repeated intravitreal injections, which contributes to nonadherence and undertreatment"

Question 10 

query_text = "What are the goals of diabetic retinopathy treatment?"
ideal_response = "The goals of treatment of diabetic retinopathy include improvement in vision, preservation of vision, and reduction in the rate of progression and frequency of retinopathy, vitreoushemorrhage, and macular edema."
